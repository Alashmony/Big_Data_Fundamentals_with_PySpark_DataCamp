A more common way to create RDDs is to load data from external datasets such as files stored in HDFS or objects in Amazon S3 buckets or from lines in a text file stored locally and pass it to SparkContext's textFile method.

A partition in Spark is the division of the large dataset with each part being stored in multiple locations across the cluster. By default Spark partitions the data at the time of creating RDD based on several factors such as available resources, external datasets etc, however, this behavior can be controlled by passing a second argument called `minPartitions` which defines the minimum number of partitions to be created for an RDD. In the first example, we create an RDD named numRDD from the list of 10 integers using SparkContext's parallelize method with 6 partitions. In the second example, we create another RDD named fileRDD using SparkContext's textFile method with 6 partitions. The number of partitions in an RDD can always be found by using the `getNumPartitions` method. In the next\n",

    "\n",
    "feature which helps RDDs in fault tolerance and optimizing resource use is the lazy evaluation. So what is lazy evaluation? Spark creates a graph from all the operations you perform on an RDD and execution of the graph starts only when an action is performed on RDD as shown in this figure. This is called lazy evaluation in Spark. The RDD transformations we will look in this video are map, filter, flatMap and union. The map\n",

The map transformation takes in a function and applies it to each element in the RDD with the result of the function being the new value of each element in the resulting RDD. In this example, the square function is applied to each element of the RDD. Let's understand this with an example. We first create an RDD using SparkContext's parallelize method on a list containing elements 1,2,3,4. Next, we apply map transformation for squaring each element of the RDD. The\n",

Suppose we have an input RDD with numbers 1,2,3,4 and we want to select numbers greater than 2, we can apply the filter transformation. Here is an example of the filter transformation wherein we use the same RDD as before to apply the filter transformation to filter out the numbers that are greater than 2. flatMap\n",

Here, you have an input RDD with two elements - \"hello world\" and \"how are you\". Applying the split function of the flatMap transformation results in 5 elements in the resulting RDD - \"hello\", \"world\", \"how\", \"are\", \"you\". As you can see, even though the input RDD has 2 elements, the output RDD now contains 5 elements. In this example, we create an RDD from a list containing the words \"hello world\" and \"how are you\". Next, we apply flatmap along with split function on the RDD to split the input string into individual words.\n",

    "union Transformation returns the union of one RDD with another RDD. In this figure, we are filtering the inputRDD and creating two RDDs - errorsRDD and warningsRDD and next we are combining both the RDDs using union transformation. To illustrate this using PySpark code, let's first create an inputRDD from a local file using SparkContext's textFile method, next we will use two filter transformations to create two RDDs errorRDD and warningsRDD and finally using union transformation we will combine them both.

    "\n",
    "Most of the real world datasets are generally key/value pairs. An example of this kind of dataset has the team name as key and the list of players as values. The typical pattern of this kind of dataset is each row is a key that maps to one or more values. In order to deal with this kind of dataset, PySpark provides a special data structure called pair RDDs. In pair RDDs, the key refers to the identifier, whereas value refers to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Creating pair RDDs\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways to create pair RDDs. The two most common ways are creating from a list of the key-value tuple or from a regular RDD. Irrespective of the method, the first step in creating pair RDDs is to get the data into key/value form. Here is an example of creating pair RDD from a list of the key-value tuple that contains the names as key and age as the value using SparkContext's parallelize method. And here is an example of creating pair RDD from regular RDDs. In this example, a regular RDD is created from a list that contains strings using SparkContext's parallelize method. Next, we create a pair RDD using map function which returns tuple with key/value pairs with key being the name and age being the value.\n",

    "4. Transformations on pair RDDs\n",
    "\n",
    "Pair RDDs are still RDDs and thus use all the transformations available to regular RDDs. Since pair RDDs contain tuples, we need to pass functions that operate on key-value pairs. A few special operations are available for this kind such as reduceByKey, groupByKey, sortByKey and join. Let's take a look at each of these four pair RDD transformations in detail now.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. reduceByKey() transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "The reduceByKey transformation is the most popular pair RDD transformation which combines values with the same key using a function. reduceByKey runs several parallel operations, one for each key in the dataset. Because datasets can have very large numbers of keys, reduceByKey is not implemented as an action. Instead, it returns a new RDD consisting of each key and the reduced value for that key. Here is an example of reducebykey transformation that uses a function to combine all the goals scored by each of the players. The result shows that player as key and total number of goals scored as value.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. sortByKey() transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting of data is necessary for many downstream applications. We can sort pair RDD as long as there is an ordering defined in the key. The sortByKey transformation returns an RDD sorted by key in ascending or descending order. Continuing our reduceByKey example, here is an example that sorts the data based on the number of goals scored by each player. A common use case of\n",

If the data is already keyed in the way that we want, the groupByKey operation groups all the values with the same key in the pair RDD. Here is an example of groupByKey transformation that groups all the airports for a particular country from an input list that contains list of tuples. Each tuple consists of country code and the corresponding airport code. Join transformation\n",

Applying join transformation on RDD1 and RDD2 merges two RDDs together by grouping elements with the same key. Here is an example that shows the result of join transformation of RDD1 and RDD2.\n",

    "Reduce action takes in a function which operates on two elements of the same type of RDD and returns a new element of the same type. The function should be commutative and associative so that it can be computed correctly in parallel. A simple example of such a function is +, which we can use to sum our RDD. Here is an example of reduce action that calculates the sum of all the elements in an RDD. In this example, input RDD is first created using SparkContext's parallelize method on a list consisting of numbers 1,3,4,6. Eexcuting reduce action results in 14 which is the sum of 1,3,4,6.\n",

In these cases, it’s common to write data out to a distributed storage systems such as HDFS or Amazon S3. saveAsTextFile action can be used to save RDD as a text file inside a particular directory. By default, saveAsTextFile saves RDD with each partition as a separate file inside a directory. Here is an example of saveAsTextFile that saves an RDD with each partition as a separate file inside a directory. However, you can change it to return a new RDD that is reduced into a single partition using the coalesce method. Here is an example of saveAsTextFile that saves RDD as a single file inside a directory. Similar to\n",

Here is an example of counting the number of values for each key in the dataset. In this example, we first create a pair RDD named rdd using SparkContext's parallelize method. Since countByKey generates a dictionary, next we iterate over the dictionary to print the each unique and number of values associated with each key as shown here. One thing to note is that countByKey should only be used on a dataset whose size is small enough to fit in memory. collectAsMap\n",
